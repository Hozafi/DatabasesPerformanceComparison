# DatabasesPerformanceComparison
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of 2 differents types of databases : Relationnal database and Graphs-oriented database.
It's goal is to compute the different time response for some request in order to look if a databases is more fast than an other. We will also look at the size on the disk for these database and also the CPU and RAM usage.

This project has been realised during our studies at INSA Rennes by Martin GOUBET and Nathan LE SOMMER
