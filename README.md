# DatabasesPerformanceComparison
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of 2 differents types of databases : Relationnal databases and Graphs-oriented databases.
Its goal is to compute the different time response for some requests in order to look if a type of database is faster than the other. We will also look at the size on the disk for these database and also the CPU and RAM usage.

This project has been realised during our studies at INSA Rennes by Martin GOUBET and Nathan LE SOMMER
